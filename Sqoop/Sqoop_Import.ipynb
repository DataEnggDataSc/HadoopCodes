        "3. When performing parallel imports, Sqoop needs a criterion by which it can split the workload. Sqoop uses a splitting column to split the workload. By default, Sqoop will identify the primary key column (if present) in a table and use it as the splitting column. The low and high values for the splitting column are retrieved from the database, and the map tasks operate on evenly-sized components of the total range. For example, if you had a table with a primary key column of id whose minimum value was 0 and maximum value was 1000, and Sqoop was directed to use 4 tasks, Sqoop would run four processes which each execute SQL statements of the form ```SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE id >= lo AND id < hi```, with (lo, hi) set to (0, 250), (250, 500), (500, 750), and (750, 1001) in the different tasks. **(In the above sqoop, user_id is the primary key of the table 'user', which has been used as splitting key as can be seen from the sqoop log printed on console)**\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If the actual values for the primary key are not uniformly distributed across its range, then this can result in unbalanced tasks. You should explicitly choose a different column with the --split-by argument. For example, --split-by employee_id. This is also applicable for sqooping from a table which does not have a primary key, hence split-by column has to be mentioned **(Below we are sqooping from a mysql table 'logs' which had the columns logid,logdate,jobname,stepname,status,error_message. None of these has been made primary key of the table. Hence we have to either mention a column with --split-by parameter, or perform a sequential import using '-m 1'. Else it will throw error -** *ERROR tool.ImportTool: Error during import: No primary key could be found for table logs. Please specify one with --split-by or perform a sequential import with '-m 1'.*\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The split-by column has to be an integer column. If a textual column is passed, it would throw error - *ERROR tool.ImportTool: Encountered IOException running import job: java.io.IOException: Generating splits for a textual index column allowed only\n",
